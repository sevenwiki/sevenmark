### Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence

{{{#tex #block #style="text-align:center; margin:20px"
E = mc^2
}}}

This famous equation shows that mass *(m)* and energy *(E)* are **interchangeable**, with *c* being the speed of light.

# Simple energy calculation
def mass_energy_equiv(mass_kg):
    """Calculate energy from mass using E=mc¬≤"""
    c = 299792458  # m/s
    energy_joules = mass_kg * c**2
    return energy_joules

[[**Historical Note** üèõÔ∏è]]
[[
This equation was published in **1905** as part of Einstein's *special relativity* paper.
The paper was titled "__Ist die Tr√§gheit eines K√∂rpers von seinem Energieinhalt abh√§ngig?__"

Fun fact: Einstein ~~initially~~ didn't receive the Nobel Prize for relativity, 
but for his work on the ^^photoelectric^^ effect!

/* Einstein's original paper can be found in 
   Annalen der Physik, vol. 18, 1905 */

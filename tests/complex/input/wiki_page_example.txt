{{{#code #lang="rust"
// Example: Safe memory management
fn safe_example() {
    let data = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Data: {:?}", data);
    // Memory automatically freed
}

### Package Management

Rust uses **Cargo** for:
- ~~Manual dependency management~~ â†’ Automatic dependency resolution
- Building projects with `cargo build`
- Running tests with `cargo test`
- Publishing to ^^crates.io^^
